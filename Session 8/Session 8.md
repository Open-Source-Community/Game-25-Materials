# Game Design - Session 8 Summary

## 1. Objective

The **objective** is the main goal the player is trying to achieve. It gives direction, motivation, and a reason to keep playing.

- **Short-Term Objective**: Achieved within a level or session. Provides immediate goals and feedback.
- **Long-Term Objective**: Spans the whole game. Represents the overarching story or ultimate purpose.

**Examples**:

- *NieR: Automata*: Short-term – complete missions; Long-term – uncover the truth behind the android-machine war.
- *Super Mario Bros*: Short-term – reach the flagpole; Long-term – rescue Princess Peach.

## 2. Rules

**Rules** define what players can and can't do. They create structure, fairness, and consistency in gameplay.

- Guide behavior
- Establish boundaries
- Support challenge and engagement

**Examples**:

- *Chess*: Each piece moves in a defined way.
- *Minecraft*: Can’t sleep if enemies are nearby.
- *Ori and the Blind Forest*: Access restricted until specific abilities are unlocked.

## 3. Core Loop

The **core loop** is the main cycle of repeated player actions. It keeps gameplay engaging and rewarding.

**Basic Structure**: Action → Reward → Progress → Repeat

**Example** (*Ori and the Blind Forest*):  
Discover → Fight → Collect → Open New Area → Repeat

---

## 4. Feedback

**Feedback** is how the game responds to the player's actions. It shows success, failure, or progress, helping the player adapt.

- Audio, visual, haptic, and narrative forms

---

## 5. Balance

**Game balance** ensures all gameplay elements are fair, meaningful, and enjoyable.

- **Ability Balance**: All abilities are situationally useful (e.g., Ori’s skills).
- **Risk vs. Reward**: High-risk actions offer high-value rewards (e.g., NieR side quests).
- **System Balance**: Progression and upgrades should be neither too fast nor too grindy.

### Flow

**Flow** is the state of deep focus and immersion. Achieved by balancing challenge with player skill.

**To Maintain Flow**:

1. Gradually increase difficulty
2. Provide responsive controls and feedback
3. Avoid extremes of boredom or frustration

---

## 6. Fun

**Fun** is the ultimate goal of game design. All systems—objectives, feedback, balance, flow—should serve the player’s enjoyment.

> If the game isn’t fun, nothing else matters.
